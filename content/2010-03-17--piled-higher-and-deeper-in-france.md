This morning I read the [latest *Piled Higher & Deeper*][phd] about *égalité des
chances*.

[ ![Contes de la route: Equal Opportunity]({filename}/images/2010/phd1292_1.gif) ][phd]

I am part of the few people who do a PhD after a *grande école*. The part about
"Good job €€€€" vs "Crappy job" is quite true – except that, from what I
experienced, these "good jobs" are often boring, non-technical ones: contract
managers, directors, etc. The kind of job that takes 50+ hours a week, plus many
weekends. Not my cup of tea. And that is just why I decided to do a PhD: it is
*very* interesting and rewarding, *and* I have enough free time to do what I
like to do besides my work.
