Another year (or two), another blog engine :smiley: I've now switched to [Pelican][],
a static blog engine written in Python. So far so good: it works well, is fast,
and there's a great community working on a lot of nice plugins and themes
(including this one).

Now let's hope I'll write a little more :smiley:
