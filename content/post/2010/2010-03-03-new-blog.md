After more than two months of silence, I'm back! And, once again, with a brand
new blog...

So, why did I change again? Many reasons: [Tumblr][] was annoying (non-free, no
control over your data, simplistic template system). Before that, [Dotclear][]
required constant attention to make it was up-to-date because of security issues
(and it would have been even worse with [WordPress][]...). I realized that what
I really want is something that generates a static website: plain (X)HTML files
are *much* safer than *any* dynamic website! However I do not want to do
everything by hand, so I need something that generates these static files from
some human-readable markup (preferably [Markdown][]). I also need to track
everything I do on my data, to backup it easily, and to be able to quickly
revert to an older version: I want to use [Git][] on my blog. And since I now use
[Emacs][] all day long, I definitely want something that integrates well in
Emacs.

Several static blog generators are available:

* [BlazeBlogger][]: quite nice! Written in bash, Markdown syntax... However,
  nothing for Emacs, and it uses a kind-of-version-control system that I do not
  like very much (it adds a lot of files to my git repository and just logs
  "this post was edited" without being able to revert to a previous version, so
  what's the point?).
* [nanoblogger][]: written in bash too. Seems too complex for what I want. Plus,
  it describes itself as "slow"...
* [Jekyll][]: close to perfect. It uses the Markdown syntax, has a nice template
  engine, integrates very well with Git (it's hosted on [GitHub][], which I like
  very much, and is even used for [GitHub Pages][]). An [Emacs mode][jkmx] is
  available. It has some very good ideas, like its [YAML front matter][]. But
  Jekyll is written in [Ruby][], which is far from being my
  [favorite language][python], and it lacks some features I like (tags...).

I finally decided to do something much funnier: write my own blog engine in
[Python][]. It took me a few days, but now it's done: [Golbarg][] is born!

This brand new engine is written 100% in Python. It uses the [Jinja 2][] template
engine, [python-markdown][] for turning Markdown into HTML, and [PyYAML][] for
managing posts headers and metadata. `golbarg.el` is bundled, so every Emacs
user can enjoy `golbarg-mode`. And all of this is of course available under the
terms of the [GNU GPLv3][] license.

Golbarg is hosted on [GitHub][golbarg], as well as [this blog][]. I also made
Golbarg available on the [Python package index][pypi] (yes, you can install it
with a simple `pip install Golbarg`!). Except for the comments in the source
code, there is very little [documentation][] available... So if you want to give
Golbarg a try, look at the source of this blog, it's probably the best way to
dive in.

Last few words: the old RSS feed will be available for a few weeks. Be sure to
switch to the [new feed][] as soon as possible!
