Time to change again :smiley: Actually there are several changes this time:

- **blog engine:** switched from Pelican to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), another static blog generator, also known as
  *the new cool kid in town*. **Really** fast, and so far I didn't feel I needed several plugins as I did with Pelican.
- **comments:** removed Disqus in favor of a self-hosted instance of [Isso](https://posativ.org/isso/). Because privacy!
- **analytics:** removed Piwik hosted I-don't-know-where-nor-by-whom and switched to a self-hosted instance of
  [Fathom](https://github.com/usefathom/fathom), a very *very* minimalist website analytics service. Again, because
  privacy! (This collects close to nothing: page views, referrer *domain*, and that's it. Not even user-agent, partial
  IP address or anything else…)
- **theme:** [Minimo](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/minimo), with several small contributions already.

I tried hard not to break any URL. Links to posts on the old blog *should* redirect to their new location. If they don't
and you get 404s, please tell me!

I also plan to write a little more here. Still tech stuff of course, but also probably some book reviews, and maybe some
recipes (in French) I want to keep for later reference. Don't know if this will be useful for anyone else but me… We'll
find out soon enough!
