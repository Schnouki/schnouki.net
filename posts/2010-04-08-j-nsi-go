*Go*, first solo album of Sigur Rós's singer Jón Þór Birgisson (aka Jónsi), was
released on April 6th.

Of course, I had pre-ordered it. But I'm attending to a conference in Lille this
week, so no CD for me (it hasn't arrived yet anyway). But thanks to [Spotify][],
I've been able to listen to it anyway... and, well, I could say it is *great*,
*wonderful*, *magical*, or even *insanely awesome*, but this would be an
understatement.

A little earlier, while walking in the street, I decided that I should
definitely [dent/tweet][dent] something about this album. Then I thought that
listening to Jónsi is a little bit like flying without the fear of falling. And
that's the moment I realized that writing reviews for albums is complicated
(especially when you're not using your mother tongue), and that I should
probably not even try to do that myself.

So here is [an excellent review of *Go*][review]. Now go [listen to it][listen],
you won't regret it.
