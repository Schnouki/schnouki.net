After I joined the [FSFE Fellowship][fsfe] a few months ago, I received a nice
OpenPGP smartcard. Now I'm using it for real, and I like it!

I've decided to buy two OpenPGP card readers on [Kernel concepts][]:

- *Gemalto PC Express card* for my laptop
- *SCM SCR-335* for my workstation

Both are very easy to get working on [Arch Linux][]: just install `ccid` and
`pcsclite` from the [AUR][], restart udev, start `pcscd` (`/etc/rc.d/pcscd
start`), plug your reader in, and you're good to go.

The next step is to create a key to be used with the card. There is a good
[tutorial][] on this topic on the FSFE Wiki. Only one step can be greatly
enhanced: step 12, "Removing the master key from the keyring". Here is a *much*
easier version:

1. Backup your public key: `gpg --armor --export 559C215F > publickey.asc`
2. Remove your private *and* public key from your keyring:
`gpg --delete-secret-and-public-key 559C215F`
3. Import your public key: `gpg --import publickey.asc`
4. Edit your key and set its trust level to Ultimate: `gpg --edit-key 559C215F`,
`trust`, `5`, `save`, `quit`
5. Make GPG check your smartcard and recreate the secret key stubs by itself:
`gpg --card-status`

That's it! Now you can return to the tutorial and test your card.
